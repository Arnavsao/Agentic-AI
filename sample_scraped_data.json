The use of natural gas in the transport sector has contributed to a great extent in containing the pollution due to vehicular exhaust emissions. CNG is an eco friendly green fuel and emits less pollutants. Apart from this, natural gas as CNG has been able to replace high priced hydrocarbon commodity like petrol and diesel. It is an economical than other conventional fuels. It has no evaporation leaks and spills of fuel, both during refueling and feeding of car. Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) is natural gas compressed to a pressure of 200-250 Kg/cm² (g) (due to its low density) to enhance the vehicle on-board storage capacity. GAIL and its CGD Joint Venture Companies / Subsidiaries are operating CNG stations in states of Delhi, Maharastra, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Tripura, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Haryana, Uttarkhand, Odisha, Goa, Bihar, Jharkhand and Rajasthan with around 1384 CNG stations catering to approximately 23.68 lakhs CNG vehicles. CNG - Benefits Environmental Very low level of polluting / greenhouse gas emissions Molecular structure compactness prevents the reactive processes which lead to the formation of Ozone (O3) in the Troposphere. Economical Cheaper than conventional fuel Safety Lighter than air – in case of leak no dangerous puddles Unlikely to ignite due to high ignition temperature or narrow range of ignition CNG cylinders structurally most sound and have passed every severe tests Technical Very high antiknock power allows greater performance compared to petrol one.

He also laid the foundation stone of the second Catalytic-Isodewaxing unit of Haldia Refinery and dedicated to the nation the 4 Lane ROB-cum-Flyover at Ranichak, Haldia on NH 41. The Event was attended by the Governor of West Bengal and Union Minister Shri Dharmendra Pradhan among others. Speaking on the occasion, the Prime Minister said that today is a big day for West Bengal and entire Eastern India in terms of AatmNirbharta of connectivity and availability of clean fuel. The four projects will improve both ease of living and ease of doing business in the region. These projects will also help Haldia to grow into a major hub of export-import. The Prime Minister stressed that gas-based economy is the need of the hour for India. One nation-one gas grid is an important step for meeting this need. For this, focus is on reducing cost of natural gas and expanding gas-pipeline network. Our efforts have led to a situation where India is among the highest gas consuming nations. Hydrogen Mission was announced in the budget to promote cheap and clean energy. The Prime Minister listed works in rail, road, airport, ports, waterways to improve the quality of life and business in Eastern India. He pointed out that scarcity of gas was leading to closure of industry in the region. In order to remedy this, a decision was taken to connect eastern India with the eastern and western ports. Pradhan Mantri Urja ganga Pipeline, a big part of which was dedicated today, is part of that project. 350 km Dobhi-Durgapur Pipeline will directly benefit not only West Bengal but also 10 districts of Bihar and Jharkhand. The Construction work provided 11 lakh man days employment to locals. This will also provide clean piped LPG to the kitchens and enable clean CNG vehicles. Sindri and Durgapur Fertilizer factories will get continuous gas supply. The Prime Minister asked GAIL and West Bengal to quickly finish Durgapur-Haldia section of Jagdishpur-Haldia and Bokaro-Dhamra Pipeline. As Ujjawala Scheme has resulted in much higher coverage and demand for LPG in the region, work is on for improving LPG infrastructure in the region. 90 lakh free LPG connections were given to women in West Bengal which include more than 36 lakh women belonging to SC/ST category. In last six years LPG coverage in West Bengal jumped from 41 per cent to 99 per cent. This year’s Budget has proposed 1 crore more free gas connection under Ujjwala Scheme. LPG import terminal of Haldia will play a big role in meeting the high demand as it will serve crores of families in West Bengal, Odisha, Bihar, Jharkhand, Chattisgarh, Uttar Pradesh and Northeast as more than 2 crore people will get gas from here out of which 1 crore will be beneficiary of Ujjwala scheme. The Prime Minister also said that as part of our commitment for clean fuel, work on capacity augmentation of BS-6 fuel plant was started today. This second Catalytic Dewaxing Unit will reduce our dependence on import with regard to lube-based oils. “We are moving towards a situation where we will be able to create export capacity” said the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister asserted that the central government is working tirelessly to develop West Bengal as a major trading and industrial centre. For this port-led development is a good model. Many steps have been taken to modernize Kolkata’s Syama Prasad Mookerjee PortTrust. The Prime Minister also called for strengthening the Haldia Dock Complex’s capacity and connectivity with the neighboring countries. The new flyover and proposed Multi-Modal Terminal of Inland Waterways authority will improve the connectivity. “This will lead to emergence of Haldia as a center of immense energy for AatmNirbhar India” Concluded the Prime Minister.

That is precisely the situation that gave rise to GAIL's Exploration and Production (E&P) section. The business climate saw a significant shift as the Indian economy opened up in year 2000. For GAIL, competition in our core business i.e. Midstream and downstream national gas distribution came as a result of liberization. The legislative support requiring GAIL to have secured sources of natural gas was no longer a viable option. Existing contractual field reserves were depleting rapidly. We needed to locate new sources; the writing was clearly on the wall. GAIL entered the E&P sector for strong reasons other than only ensuring natural gas supplies: Integration in supply-chain Large gap in Gas demand and supply National Gas security Balancing of Business portfolio Global opportunity From the beginning, GAIL (E&P) had a portfolio of 46 blocks altogether. However, as a result of portfolio optimization, the portfolio currently consists of the following 12 blocks in total which are followed below: E&P Stage Blocks/ Location Basin Operator Production(5 Blocks) On land: CB-ONN-2000/1 Cambay Basin GSPC On land: CB-ONN-2003/2 Cambay Basin GSPC *Offshore: A1 & A3, Myanmar Rakhine Offshore POSCO International On land: CB-ONN-2010/11 Cambay Basin GAIL On land: CB-ONN-2010/8 Cambay Basin BPRL Appraisal /Development(4 Blocks) On land: AA-ONN-2002/1 Assam-Arakan Basin JOGPL Pvt Ltd Offshore: GK-OSN-2010/1 Gujarat Kutch Basin ONGC Offshore: CY-OS/2 Cauvery Basin Invenire Energy Pvt Ltd On land: AA-ONN-2010/2 Assam-Arakan Basin OIL Exploration(3 Blocks) On land: CB-ONHP-2017/12 Cambay Basin GAIL On land: RJ-ONHP-2021/1 Barmer-Sanchor Basin GAIL *Overseas asset GAIL is also a member of National Gas Hydrate Program (NGHP) being coordinated by DGH and is actively involved in activities related to Gas Hydrate exploration.

Earlier, GAIL had entered into a bilateral MoU with SEI for scouting opportunities in different facets of energy cooperation, wherein a feasibility study was conducted by a reputed consultant on developing ethane import infrastructure in the existing SEI terminal at Hazira. ONGC has a bilateral MoU with GAIL for, inter alia, importing and handling of hydrocarbon. In view of the emergence of ethane requirement in India and proposed development of ethane infrastructure, the three parties ONGC, GAIL and SEI have joined hands. Speaking on the occasion, Shri Rajeev Kumar Singhal, Director (Business Development), GAIL said that, “Ethane has emerged as a preferred petrochemical precursor in India and development of its import facilities have gained considerable traction. Definite plans are being formulated to import ethane for domestic petrochemical plant requirements.” Echoing the sentiment, ONGC Group General Manager & Head Petrochemicals Shri Ashok Kumar, said that going forward, ethane is the fuel of the future as feedstock to Indian petrochemical industry. India is adding good petchem capacities and making available viable and affordable ethane is the key for the plans ahead. This MoU inter-alia includes cooperation with clear focus for developing ethane import facilities after gap assessment in existing Shell Hazira Terminal facilities and usage of existing pipeline routes and facilities. The MoU signed envisages to foster efficiency and swift progress of the shared project by leveraging the combined strengths of all three parties. The move coincides with the objective towards assessment of existing operational infrastructure, ensuring its sufficiency, operational flexibility and effective management of upstream and downstream uncertainties. The MoU is expected to offer new business prospects to all the parties along with offering diversification of petrochemical feedstock while aligning with the national priorities and Government of India’s Atmanirbhar Bharat (Self Reliant India) mission with manufacturing in India.

In addition, GAIL handed over one advanced life support ambulance to AIIMS, New Delhi. The flag-off was done by the Hon’ble MP in the presence of GAIL Director (HR) Shri Ayush Gupta, AIIMS Director Dr. M Srinivas, AIIMS Medical Superintendent Dr. Nirupam Madaan and other officials. The MMUs are part of Project Arogya, a flagship Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Project of GAIL. Under this project, free primary healthcare services are provided at the door-steps of the underprivileged communities in the area. Through the qualified medical team in the MMU, free medical services and medicines are provided to these communities who have limited access to the established Public Health Care system. The GPS tracked MMUs shall provide medical services to about 80 patients per day. In addition to these, low-cost sanitary napkins are also distributed and basic diagnostic tests undertaken through these MMUs. These MMUs follow an ADCR Formula of Awareness, Diagnosis, Cure and Referral. Information, Education and Communication (IEC) and Behaviour Change Communication (BCC) activities are also undertaken by the team to generate awareness on health and hygiene related topics. Services of the MMUs especially support the elderly and the physically challenged who are often unable to avail medical services available at a distance from their localities. This also considerably brings down the average medical expenses of these families. In addition to the newly flagged off MMUs, 50 MMUs are currently operational across 25 districts in 12 states under Project Arogya of GAIL CSR.
